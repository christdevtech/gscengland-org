## About Us

You May Come In As A Stranger But You'll Leave As Family

Our aspiration is for Gateway Salvation Church to serve as a secure and inviting space where you can freely pose difficult inquiries and discover a community that stands by you through life's most testing periods.

### Our Vision

At GSC, we have a mandate from God to evangelize, bring men, and equip them with word of God, by the power of the Holy Spirit.

We are committed to reach out to souls, develop and disciple them for the coming King. We are persuaded that practicing and living a holy life is the only way for a disciple to see the face of God. Hence we evangelize and engage in discipleship.
