## About Us

You May Come In As A Stranger But You'll Leave As Family

Our aspiration is for Gateway Salvation Church to serve as a secure and inviting space where you can freely pose difficult inquiries and discover a community that stands by you through life's most testing periods.

### Our Vision

At GSC, we have a mandate from God to evangelize, bring men, and equip them with word of God, by the power of the Holy Spirit.

We are committed to reach out to souls, develop and disciple them for the coming King. We are persuaded that practicing and living a holy life is the only way for a disciple to see the face of God. Hence we evangelize and engage in discipleship.

## Our Leadership

### Meet Our Pastor

**Pastor Ola & Grace Olaiya**

Pastor Ola as he is popularly called, grew up in Nigeria and accepted the life of Christ in the year 2000. He has been in the ministry since then by serving in a local church, as an evangelism leader, missions leader, part of the publicity team, preacher, youth Leader and then Senior Pastor. Ola loves to pray and engage in different types of evangelism (House to House, face to face, street evangelism etc). His passion is to see Jesus being preached to every man and for them to get to know Him as their personal Lord. Ola is a trained Architect and UK/EU Customs Compliance Professional.

Grace is Pastor Ola's lovely wife and they both serve God together with all their hearts. She grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, after her parents relocated from Cameroon when she was just 3 years of age. Grace loves to study the word of God and enjoys sharing her passion about the bible! She loves praying and listening to spiritual sermons. Grace is a trained Geographer and an Analytics Consultant by profession.

They are blessed with a dear son.

Working alongside Ola & Grace is a growing core team of volunteers who together carry the weight and practicalities of the Church vision.
